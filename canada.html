    <h3 class="margin-top">Should you move to Canada?</h3>
    <p>Due to a welcoming immigration programs of Canada, a lot of people are wondering
       whether it is something they should do. I would like to share a framework to make
       this decision easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      1.	Don’t start by thinking that this is something you cannot undo. 
      In other words, don’t feel stressed thinking that you are going to leave 
      your home country permanently. Have a flexible mindset to return back to 
      your home country if you later on find out that Canada does not offer 
      everything you hoped for.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.	Make sure you have a specific reason to move to Canada. This could be 
      increasing the rate of savings, changing career to another industry, interested 
      in the wester way of living. Having this reason is important as it will help you 
      withstand the struggle that you’ll go through when you relocate.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.	If increasing the rate of savings is the reason for your move, then please 
      do a thorough analysis by projecting your savings for the span of 10 years in 
      your home country vs Canada. Here, the important factors to consider are monthly 
      living expense, one-time yearly expense, average salary increment rate, and taxes. 
      Check salary for your profession on 
      <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/member/home/companies.htm" target="_blank" 
      class="fancy-links">Glassdor</a> 
      and taxes on 
      <a href="https://neuvoo.ca/tax-calculator/" target="_blank" 
      class="fancy-links">Neuvoo</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      4.	If you belong to an industry of profession that pays lower than an industry 
      where there is established corporate culture in your home country then it would 
      mostly make sense to move to Canada Examples of such an industry and profession 
      are healthcare and pharmacist. Example of and industry and a profession that 
      does not fall under this category are IT industry and Software developer.
